    body: This is **Handshake**, crafted to be a quick solution for redirecting your clients/contacts to your other content & social media. It's super easy to set up, built with GitHub Pages in mind, features 3 gorgeous themes and icons from FontAwesome. Oh, and this body of text even supports Markdown. Created by [Jo√£o "Belve" Gomes](http://www.twitter.com/joaobelve) for [his own personal website](http://joaobelve.github.io).

# Up next, you may list contact information so page viewers can get in touch.
# These will be rendered as small icons visible on the bottom of the page.

# Every item is required to have the following keys: `icon` and `url`.
# Optionally, you can provide a `title` item which will be thrown in the `title`
# attribute inside the `<a>` tag when rendering. The `icon` key should follow
# FontAwesome's naming scheme for icons, excluding the `fa-` part (example:
# for displaying a Medium icon, you would use a `fa-icon` class, so you can
# just type `medium` and we throw in the `fa-` prefix for you). You can search
# for icons' names at FontAwesome's website: http://fontawesome.io/icons/.

# SITE BODY

# This is where you type out what you want your site to display. You have two
# fields you need to fill in: a heading (required), and some text body. You
# can use HTML for links and markup formatting (example: `<strong>` or `<em>`),
# but not images. Image tags will not be displayed and will be ignored.

# OTHER CONFIGURATIONS

# We provide you with 3 color themes you can choose! Try them all: `sky`,
# `forest` and `coalmine`. You can configure that here. If nothing is provided,
# `sky` will be default.

theme: sky

# By default, we will build your site on the root folder of the project,
# as this is a requirement for the page to function on GitHub Pages (for more
# information on this, please visit https://pages.github.com/). You can specify
# a different destination target folder here if you wish.
